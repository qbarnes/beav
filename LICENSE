Thank you for your work on BEAV.   I do intend to use the GNU copyright
in the future.   You can put the current BEAV under GNU now if
you would like.   I have a list of things to do to BEAV so a new
release in not imminent.   The current version is 1.40 for your
information.   Hope this helps.
Pete.
